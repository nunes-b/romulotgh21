# Rômulo Nunes - Tech Enthusiast & Backend Engineer 👨‍💻

## Welcome to My Space! 🚀

Hello, I'm Rômulo Nunes, a seasoned backend developer with a profound passion for technology since 2008. At the tender age of 9, I embarked on my tech journey by disassembling my first computer—a vintage Windows 98 machine. Despite the hardware challenges, especially in the memory buses, my curiosity and determination only grew.

## 🛠️ Tech Toolbox

I strongly believe that technology is a powerful tool, and I've been diligently building my toolbox ever since. Resilience is my key asset, and I thrive on challenges. If there's something I don't know, consider it a temporary state before I dive into learning. Incompetence, to me, is merely a stepping stone towards knowledge.

## 💡 Always Curious, Forever Learning

I am a perpetually curious individual in the realm of technology. The pursuit of answers is a never-ending journey, and I don't subscribe to the notion that the ultimate answer is 42. My enthusiasm for learning is unwavering, and I'm continuously expanding my skill set, discovering new tools along the way.
