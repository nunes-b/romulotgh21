### Hey, you. Nice to see you here.
#### I'm RÃ´mulo Nunes and ...
<p>I currently work as a <strong>Backend developer</strong> and I am studying JavaScript, Node.js, and testing methodologies like a "jest". I am also learn clean architecture patterns and clean code principles, as I am constantly seeking improvement. I thrive on challenges but am deeply committed to honing my backend skills. My current role involves API development and the maintenance of business rules. Additionally, I manage production AWS clusters using EC2 instances.
  My skill set includes expertise in API development with Node, Express, and Prisma ORM. I excel in code version control and, much like the Mayans and Aztecs, I meticulously manage versioning line by line. 
I firmly believe that it's not feasible to rely on a single tool for all tasks. Therefore, in addition to my JavaScript studies, I dedicate my free time to exploring other technology stacks and how they can complement my goals.
I hold the belief that selecting the right tools is the first crucial step in achieving any development objective.</p>
